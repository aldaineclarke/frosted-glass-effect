# frosted-glass-effect
This effect is gaining popularity and is really neat.
It is relatively simple to get up and running 
For this example a fixed image was used then inherited by the children elements
This ensured that the image wouldn't be resized for the child elements which would make the effect seem out of place
A psuedo class is also used which is in charge of blurring out the contents of the container

This is the 4th project in the 26 projects challenge
